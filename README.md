#  Agile Monte Carlo Simulator

A lightweight, browser-based tool for simulating software project costs, timelines, and profitability using **Monte Carlo methods**. Built with **HTML, JavaScript, and Chart.js**, this tool helps agile teams make data-driven decisions under uncertainty â€” no installation, no Python, no backend required.

Perfect for:
- Project scoping
- Bid pricing
- Risk analysis
- Client proposals
- Internal planning

## ðŸ”§ Features

 **Runs entirely in the browser** â€“ just open the `.html` file  
 **No dependencies** â€“ works offline  
 **Real Monte Carlo simulation** (1,000â€“10,000 iterations)  
 **Interactive inputs** with sliders and real-time feedback  
 **Visual outputs**:
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
- Profit distribution
- Duration forecast
- Profit margin
 **Risk modeling** for:
- Uncertain scope
- Variable team velocity
- Hidden bugs (rework)
- Changing priorities
 **Managed service costs** (optional ongoing support as % of one-off cost)
 **Cloud infrastructure toggle** (IaaS/PaaS optional)
 **Export results to CSV**âœ… **Clear sprint estimation**: "X SP â‰ˆ Y sprints â‰ˆ Z months"

##  How It Works

The simulator runs thousands of possible project outcomes by varying key uncertain factors:

| Input | Distribution |
|------|--------------|
| Scope | Triangular + drift (from changing priorities) |
| Velocity | Normal (mean = 20 SP/sprint, std dev from risk) |
| Rework | Beta + exponential (driven by bug risk) |
| Costs | Daily rates Ã— duration |
| Managed Service | Optional % of one-off cost (annual) |

After simulation, it provides:
- **P50, P80, P90 estimates** for cost and time
- **Profitability chance**
- **Sensitivity insights**

This helps you **quote confidently**, **plan for risk**, and **optimize team structure**.

##  Inputs Explained

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Daily Rates** | Cost per day for Dev, QA, PM (adjust for onsite/offshore) |
| **Expected Scope (SP)** | Total story points. 20 SP â‰ˆ 1 sprint (2 weeks) |
| **Risk: Uncertain Scope** | Initial ambiguity in requirements |
| **Risk: Variable Team Speed** | Sprint velocity fluctuation |
| **Risk: Hidden Bugs** | Technical debt, defects, rework effort |
| **Risk: Changing Priorities** | Mid-project scope growth |
| **Cloud IaaS/PaaS** | Optional monthly cloud cost range |
| **Managed Service** | Ongoing support as % of initial project cost |
| **Number of Simulations** | 1Kâ€“10K runs for accuracy |

##  Outputs

| Metric | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Median Scope** | Most likely final scope in SP |
| **Median Duration** | Expected timeline in months |
| **Median TCO** | Total Cost of Ownership (one-off + managed service) |
| **Profit Margin** | Estimated margin (with 20% markup) |
| **P80 TCO** | Budget to be 80% confident of staying under |
| **Chance of Profit** | Probability of making money |
| **P90 Duration** | Timeline to be 90% confident of meeting |
